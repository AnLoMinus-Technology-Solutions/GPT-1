# Glossary of Key Terms and Definitions for GPT-1

GPT-1, or the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1, is a natural language processing model developed by OpenAI in 2018. Here are some key terms and definitions related to GPT-1:

## Transformer

The transformer is a type of neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data, such as language. The transformer was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and has since become a popular architecture for natural language processing models.

## Pre-training

Pre-training refers to the process of training a model on a large corpus of text before fine-tuning it for a specific task. Pre-training allows a model to learn general patterns and structures of language, which can be transferred to a variety of downstream tasks.

## Generative

A generative model is a type of model that can generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on. In the context of natural language processing, a generative model can generate new sentences that are grammatically correct and semantically coherent.

## Language model

A language model is a type of model that assigns probabilities to sequences of words in a language. A language model can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

## Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning refers to the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task by training it on a smaller dataset that is specific to that task. Fine-tuning allows a model to learn task-specific patterns and structures of language.

## Perplexity

Perplexity is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a language model. It measures how well a language model can predict a sequence of words given the preceding words. A lower perplexity score indicates better performance.

## Transfer learning

Transfer learning refers to the process of transferring knowledge learned from one task to another task. In the context of natural language processing, transfer learning can be used to train a language model on a large corpus of text and then transfer that knowledge to a variety of downstream tasks.

## Neural network

A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that process input data and produce output data.

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is a technique used to train neural networks by computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. Backpropagation allows the model to adjust its parameters to minimize the loss function.

## Gradient descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function. Gradient descent is commonly used to train neural networks.

## Stochastic gradient descent

Stochastic gradient descent is a variant of gradient descent that computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to a randomly selected subset of the training data. Stochastic gradient descent can be faster and more memory-efficient than batch gradient descent.

## Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Dropout randomly drops out a fraction of the nodes in a layer during training, forcing the remaining nodes to learn more robust features.

## Batch size

Batch size refers to the number of samples processed by a model in one training iteration. A larger batch size can lead to faster training, but may require more memory.

## Epoch

An epoch is a complete pass through the entire training dataset during training. Training a model for multiple epochs can improve its performance, but may also increase the risk of overfitting.
